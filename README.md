# Smart-Vehicle-parking-system

A smart vehicle parking system based on shortest distance and vehicle size.

As the vehicle enters the parking slot, the system gets alerted and finds the nearest empty parking space for the vehicle.
At the same time it also considers the length of the vehicle while finding the parking space.

Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect occupancy of parking spaces and dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the minimum distance from the entrance up till the parking space.
